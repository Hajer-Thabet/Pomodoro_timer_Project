# Pomodoro Timer Project


## Context

This React app is a replicated Pomodoro Timer from Thinkful's course. I collaborated with two others for this project. This taught me the importance of teamwork, what pair programming is about (our case was one driver, 2 navigators), and was a reason to showcase our knowledge of the coursework so far. We were learning React in this stage and found this project to really solidify our understanding of how state, props, and components were broken down.
