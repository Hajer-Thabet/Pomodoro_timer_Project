# Pomodoro Timer Project


The Pomodoro technique is a time management method.
The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro. Pomodoro Timer is great for those who have a hard time focusing especially students.
